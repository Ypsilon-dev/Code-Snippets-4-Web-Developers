/*
This code is using jQuery to set the height of all elements with the class "section" to the height of the tallest element.

$('.section').each(function() { ... });: We select all elements with the class "section" using the jQuery selector $('.section'). We then use the .each() method to loop through each element and execute a function for each one.

Overall, this code is a simple and efficient way to ensure that all elements with the class "section" have the same height, which can be useful for creating consistent layouts.
